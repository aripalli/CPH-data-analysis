					This website was created in order to demonstrate skills learned in the course 02806 at DTU. The course is called <a href="http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02806">Social data analysis and visualzation </a> and is all about enabling students to create visualizations of complex data sets and to apply common strategies for detecting sentiment in media.

				<p>
				For many years, Copenhagen has been ranked one of the top countries for quality of living, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20110906-living-in-copenhagen">(see article)</a>. But do foreigners have the same living standards as the local Danish people? The goal and motivation for this project is to analyze socio economic data and see how and where international people and danes of Copenhagen are living. Furthermore, see if some areas show certain trends and try to explain why. 
				</p>


				<p>

                    <i> The Icelandic quest:</i> For a long time Iceland was under the Danish monarchy or from 1380 to 1944 when Iceland decided it would be clever to declare independence when Denmark was under the nazi occupation and could not to anything about it. However, through the years Copenhagen has been like a second capital for Icelandic people as many Icelanders come to Copenhagen to gain better life quality as in work/education/partying. Many of higher educated Icelanders have come to Copenhagen to study as the Icelandic education system is not as good as the danish (It's difficult to offer a very good education system for an only population of 330,000). Also, Icelandic people learn danish from the age 12 to 18 and gives them the idea that they are excellent in talking danish.
				</p>
				<p>	
                    Therefore, Icelandic people are quite fond of Copenhagen and for the Icelandic group members of the project wanted to see how many Icelandic people lives here in Copenhagen and is there any specific district Icelandic people attracts to? Also, when the financial crisis hit Iceland, many Icelandic people went to the nordic countries to try to find work. Can we see an increase of Icelandic people in Denmark after 2008 and now when Iceland economy is blooming (Iceland is now ranked as top ranked countries in GDP per capita comparisons  (http://vi.is/%C3%BAtg%C3%A1fa/sk%C3%BDrslur/the_icelandic_economy_2016.pdf)) if the Icelandic people are moving back home or?
                </p>
                <p>	
                    Also, we wanted to know if there is anyother nations as the Icelandic people how has a high population here in Denmark and find out the connection.
                </p>
                <p>	
                    We wanted also to see where the "wealthy" districts are in Copenhagen and if we could find if there are any interesting features (from the socioeconomic) that could indicate the district is a "wealthy" area or not and from these features if we could predict the "wealthy" areas and how good these predictions are. Also, in these "wealthy" area what is the percentage of Danes and foreigners? Are only Danes who live in a wealthy area or?
