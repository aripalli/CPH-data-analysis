					This website was created in order to demonstrate skills learned in the course 02806 at DTU. The course is called <a href="http://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02806">Social data analysis and visualzation </a> and is all about enabling students to create visualizations of complex data sets and to apply common strategies for detecting sentiment in media. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKOMIq7J1a0&feature=youtu.be">Here</a> is the preliminary video we made about the project.

                    <i>The quest: </i> For a long time Iceland was part of the Danish monarchy (from 1380 to 1944). Icelandic declared its independence when Denmark was under nazi occupation and
					could not do anything (clever Icelandic people!). 
                    However, through the years Copenhagen has been like a second capital for the Icelandic people as many Icelanders seek a better life by moving here. 
					Many Icelandic people have a danish degree (especially higher education) as the Icelandic education system is not great (It's difficult to offer a very good education system
					to a population of only 330,000). The Icelandic people learn danish from the age 12 to 18, and gives them the idea that they are fluent danish speakers (Kan jeg få en øl?
					is what most Icelandic people can say). 
                    <br>
					<br>
                    It is not only the historical reasons that make the Icelandic people seek a better life in Copenhagen.
					For many years Copenhagen has been ranked one of the top countries for quality of living,
					<a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20110906-living-in-copenhagen">(see article)</a>.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, We wanted to investigate how many Icelandic people live here in Copenhagen and how it has changed through the years. 
					Did the financial crisis in Iceland make more Icelandic people move to Copenhagen seeking a better life (seeking job, education etc.)
					and are Icelandic people now returning to Iceland now when the Icelandic economy is blooming (Iceland is now ranked as one of the top countries based on GDP per capita
					<a href="http://vi.is/%C3%BAtg%C3%A1fa/sk%C3%BDrslur/the_icelandic_economy_2016.pdf">(see article)</a>) or is the Copenhagen life too good? 
                    <br>                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Districts_of_Copenhagen_urban_area.png" alt="Districts" style="width:250px;height:100%;" align="right">
                    We also wanted to investigate if there are any other countries which have strong connections to Denmark and try to find out why that is.
                    Are the other nordic countries also seeking the good life here in Copenhagen? 
                    <br>
					<br>
                    Copenhagen is normally split up into ten large districts as seen on the figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Copenhagen">(see source)</a> on the right.
					We wanted to see if there are some districts that Danes or other foreign countries prefer and try to find out why that is?
                    <br>
                    We also wanted to split up the districts even more and try to see for instance where the wealthy areas of Copenhagen are and see what features are significant for wealthy
					areas and how well we can predict if a district is wealthy or not. We also look at other features and try to predict them.
