    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two datasets, both from the [Open Copenhagen data](http://data.kk.dk/) website. The website contains all open data from the Copenhagen kummune (e. Municipality). We downloaded the files directly from the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is the population by year, district, age, and citizenship. You can find the dataset **[here](http://data.kk.dk/dataset/befolkningen-efter-ar-bydel-alder-og-statsborgerskab)**. We will call this dataset nationality through the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is the socioeconomic dataset. This is a very large dataset with a lot of information. You can find the dataset **[here](http://data.kk.dk/dataset/samlede-socio-data-kbh)**. We will call this dataset socioeconomic through the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to know whether it is possible to predict where and how international and Danes live in Copenhagen. Furthermore, see if some areas show certain trends and try to explain why there is a trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is ideal to make the visualizing of foreigners in Copenhagen. It contains information on the population of every nation from 1992 to 2015 and also splits Copenhagen ten districts (and one unknown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is ideal to use for the prediction has it contains a lot of features which could be useful and interesting to use to predict where people live and if there is any trend (e.g. If through the years there is more trend of Danes living in a specific district or more of international people).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is trying to see what features are import to use when predicting for \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Predict how many have a high income.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Predict how many are above 65 years old.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Predict how many danes live in a given rode.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and also create a killer visualising for the user. The first visualising is the nationalities in Copenhagen over the years. Where the user can visualise the change of population for every country through the years. There can the user see if a specific country has a increase trend of living in Copenhagen or specific district.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next visualising is the interactive map where the user can experince the percentage of Danes in specifics rode (Rode is copenhagen splited up into very small districts and is based on historical reasons.) through the years. Also, the user can visualise where the wealthy areas are in Copenhagen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another visualising is the clustering of similar roder through the years. The clustering is based on four features and displayes similiar roder in the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic stats. Let's understand the dataset better\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is pretty clean, however we want get remove every useless data in the .csv files for the website. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the nationality dataset, we wanted to find the ratio between a specific nationality and all foreign nationality both in every district and for all Copenhagen. We feel like inspecting the ratio will also give a good sense of how distinct nations are changing through the years for both the unique district and all of Copenhagen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: (Not true values!)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Number of Icelandic people living in Østerbro the year 2015 was 100, however the total number of foreigners living in Østerbro was 1000. So, Icelandic people counted as 100/1000 = 0.1% of the foreigners living in Østerbro.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Number of foreigners living in Copenhagen the year 2015 was 100 however the total number of Danes living in Copenhagen was 1000. So, foreigners in Copenhagen counted as 100/1000 = 0.1% of the people living in Copenhagen.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted also to change the numerical value of districts and nations to their names to give a better understanding of the visualising. Unfortunalty, the decoder for the nation number to nation name had only the Danish name of the country. However, it is always fun to learn a new danish word :). Also, we wanted to sum up all of the districts each year for every nation to be able see the number of specific nation living in Copenhagen not just in a district in Copenhagen.\n",
